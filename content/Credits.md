This book provides an introduction for freshman students into the world of classical mechanics and special relativity theory. Much of physics is build on the basic ideas from classical mechanics. Hence an early introduction to the topic can be beneficial for new students. However, at the start of studying physics, lots of the required math is not available yet. That means that all kind of concepts that are very useful can not be invoked in the lectures and teaching. That does not have to be a disadvantage. It can also be used to help the students by introducing some math and coupling it directly to the physics, making more clear why mathematics should be studied and what its 'practical use' is. With this book, we aim to introduce new students directly at the start of their studies into the world of physics, more specifically the world of Newton, Galilei and many others who laid the foundation of physics. We aim to help students getting a good understanding of the theory, i.e. the framework of physics. What is 'work' and why do we use it? Why is kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and not $\frac{1}{3}mv^2$ or $\frac{1}{2}mv^3$? Both 3's are fundamentally wrong, but what is behind it?

## About this book

Classical mechanics is the starting point of physics. Over the centuries, via [Newton's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) three fundamental laws formulated around 1687, we have built a solid framework describing the material world around us. On these pages, you will find a textbook with animations, demos, interactive elements and exercises for studying introductory classical mechanics. Moreover, we will consider the first steps of [Einstein's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) Special Theory of Relativity published 1905.

This material is made to support first year students from the BSc Applied Physics at Delft University of Technology during their course *Classical Mechanics and Relativity Theory*, MechaRela for short. But, of course, anybody interested in Classical Mechanics and Special Relativity is more than welcome to use this book.

With this e-book our aim is to provide learning material that is:

* self-contained
* easy to modify and thus improve over the years
* interactive by providing demos, interactive elements and exercises next to the lectures

This book is based on [Mudde & Rieger 2025](https://interactivetextbooks.tudelft.nl/dev/mechanica/). <!-- replace link by DOI --> That book was already beyond introductory level and presumed a solid basis in both calculus and basic mechanics. All texts in this book were revised, additional examples and exercises were included, picture and drawings have been updated and interactive materials have been included. Hence, this book should be considered a stand-alone new version. Note that we made good use of other open educational resources, several exercises stem from such resources. Where we use external materials, we acknowledge and credit the original sources.


### Special features

In this book you will find some 'special' features. Some of these are indicated by their own formatting:

```{exercise} &#127798;
Each chapter includes a variety of exercises tailored to the material. We distinguish between exercises embedded within the instructional text and those presented on separate pages. The in-text exercises should be completed while reading, as they offer immediate feedback on whether the concepts and mathematics are understood. The separate exercise sets are intended for practice after reading the text and attending the lectures.

To indicate the level of difficulty, each exercise is marked with 1, 2, or 3 &#127798;
```

```{intermezzo} Intermezzos
Intermezzos contain background information on the topic or on the people that worked on relevant concepts.
```

```{experiment} Experiments
We include some basic experiments that can be done at home.
```

```{example} Examples
We provide various examples showcasing, e.g., calculations.
```

````{tip} Python
We include in-browser python code, as well as downloadable .py files which can be executed locally. If there is an in-browser, press the ON-button to 'enable compute'. Try it by pushing the ON-button and subsequently the play button and see the output in de code-cell below.

```{code-cell} python
print("The square root of 2 is: ", 2 ** 0.5)
```
````

```{raw:typst}
The interactive elements, such as Python code, hover over functionality, embedded youtube clips etc, only work in the online environment, not in the pdf or printed book. Where possible we included qr codes and links to the online clips.

```

New concepts, such as *{abbr}`Free body diagram (a simplified drawing that shows all the external forces acting on a single object, isolated from its surroundings.)`*, are introduced with a hover-over. If you move your mouse over the italicized part of the text, you will get a short explanation. 

You have the opportunity to download some of the materials as Jupyter Notebook file and play with the code offline. We advise you to use [Jupyter Lab in combination with MyST](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-jupyter-lab-myst).


### Feedback

This is the first version of this book. Although many have work on it and several iterations have been made, there might still be issues. Do you see a mistake? Do you have suggestions for exercises? Are parts missing or abundant? Tell us! You can use the `Feedback` button in the top right of the screen. You will need a (free) GitHub account to report an issue!
