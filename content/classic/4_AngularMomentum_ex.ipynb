    "Consider a particle of mass $m$ that is attached to a massless rope of length R. The other end of the rope is fixed in the origin and is free to rotate in a horizontal plane. The particle is made to move in a circular motion wit a velocity that has a constant magnitude $v$. Show that on $m$ a force should act that is parallel to the rope at all times. Gravity is to be ignored.\n",

    "::::{tab-set}\n",
    ":::{tab-item} Interpret the problem\n",
    "Let's start with a drawing: $m$ is moving over a circle in a horizontal plane. We draw its position vector, $\\vec{r}$, its velocity vector, $\\vec{v}$ and a force, $\\vec{F}$ that can act on $m$.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is clearly a 2-dimensional problem: both $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{v}$ do change in the plane while $m$ moves along the circle.\n",
    "Moreover, since $\\vec{v}$ is not a constant vector (it does have constant magnitude $v$, but clearly its direction constantly changes), we can anticipate that a force **must** be acting on $m$. After all, $\\vec{p} = m \\vec{v}$ is not a constant and, thus, according to N2 a force must act on $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have at least two options to approach this problem: via momentum or via angular momentum. We opt for the latter, as we anticipate that the angular momentum may be a constant.\n",

    "::: \n",
    ":::{tab-item} Develop the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use angular momentum: $\\vec{l} \\equiv \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}$. In this case $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$ are always perpendicular ($m$ moves over a circle and, hence $\\vec{v}$ is tangent to the circle at all times). Thus we can write:\n",

    "$$\\vec{l} = \\vec{r} \\times m\\vec{v} = mRv \\hat{z}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\hat{z}$ a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of motion. \n",

    "\n",
    "Thus, we have for this case: $\\vec{l} = mRv \\hat{z}$: a constant vector as $m, R, v$ are all constant.\n",
    "Consequently, from N2 for angular momentum we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{l} = const \\rightarrow \\frac{d\\vec{l}}{dt} = 0 \\Rightarrow \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F} = 0$$\n",

    "Our conclusion does make sense: the velocity of $m$ is constant in magnitude, thus no force can act parallel to $\\vec{v}$ since that would 'speed up' $m$. But a force is required to keep $m$ in its circular orbit. After all, its velocity is changing with time and that requires a force acting on $m$.\n",

Moreover, we have (in blue) indicated our coordinate system. This is useful, as we anticipate that we will have to deal with torques and angular momentum. \n",
    "Furthermore, we have drawn the position vector (in green) of both masses with the pivot point as our origin.\n",

    "The seesaw is in balance if the sum of torques on it is zero. Thus, we calculate the net torque (using that the seesaw itself has no mass). We have chosen the pivot point as our origin, thus\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_i = -L\\hat{x} \\times -mg\\hat{z} + 0 \\times \\vec{F}_p + L\\hat{x} \\times -2mg\\hat{z}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is zero, then the seesaw will not start rotating.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is non-zero, the seesaw will start rotating and we analyze this by using  $\\frac{d\\vec{l}}{dt} = \\sum \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_i$\n",

    "\n",
    "The net torques is clearly non-zero: the seesaw is unstable (for $t \\gt 0$). It will start to rotate clockwise and we can find its initial acceleration as follows.\n",

    "If we denote the velocity of $m$ as $\\vec{v}$ then $2m$ will have $-\\vec{v}$ as velocity. This is of course a consequence of both sitting om the seesaw with equal distance to the pivot point. Furthermore, both velocities are always perpendicular to the position vector of their mass. Again this is a consequence of sitting on the seesaw, that can only rotate around the pivot point.\n",
