    "### Circular motion\n",
    "Consider a particle of mass $m$ that is attached to a massless rope of length R. The other end of the rope is fixed in the origin and is free to rotate in a horizontal plane. The particle is made to move in a circular motion wit a velocity that has a constant magnitude $v$. Show that on $m$ a force should act that is parallel to the rope at all times. Gravity is to be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "::::{tab-set}\n",
    ":::{tab-item} Interpret the problem\n",
    "Let' start with a drawing: $m$ is moving over a circle in a horizontal plane. We draw its position vector, $\\vec{r}$, its velocity vector, $\\vec{v}$ and a force, $\\vec{F}$ that can act on $m$.\n",

    ":alt: a particle moving along a circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is clearly a 2-dimensional problem: both $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{v}$ do change in the plane while $m$ moves along the circle.\n",
    "Moreover, since $\\vec{v}$ is not a constant vector (it does have constant magnitude $v$, but clearly its direction constantly changes), we can anticipate that a force **must** be acting on $m$. After all, $\\vec{p} = m \\vec{v}$ is not a constant and, thus, according to N2 a force must act on $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have at least two options to approach this problem: via momentum or via angular momentum. We opt for the latter, as we anticipate that the angular momentum may be a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: \n",
    ":::{tab-item} Develop the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use angular momentum: $\\vec{l} \\equiv \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}$. In this case $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$ are always perpendicular ($m$ moves over a circle and, hence $\\vec{v}$ is tangent to the circle at all times). Thus we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{l} = \\vec{r} \\times m\\vec{v} = mRv \\hat{z}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\hat{z}$ a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of motion. \n",
    "Next we may use Newton 2 for angular momentum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\vec{l}}{dt} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and from this law find restrictions on $\\vec{F}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: \n",
    ":::{tab-item} Evaluate the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we have for this case: $\\vec{l} = mRv \\hat{z}$: a constant vector as $m, R, v$ are all constant.\n",
    "Consequently, from N2 for angular momentum we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{l} = const \\rightarrow \\frac{d\\vec{l}}{dt} = 0 \\Rightarrow \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we see that $\\vec{F}$ must be parallel to $\\vec{r}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: \n",
    ":::{tab-item} Assess the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our conclusion does make sense: the velocity of $m$ is constant in magnitude, thus no force can act parallel to $\\vec{v}$ since that would 'speed up' $m$. But a force is required to keep $m$ in its circular orbit. After all, its velocity is changing with time and that requires a force acting on $m$.\n",

    "### Unstable See-Saw\n",
    "We have a seesaw as shown in the figure below. On the left side a mass $m$ is place, on the right side, $2m$. Both arms of the seesaw have a length $L$. For now, we keep the seesaw horizontal. But at $t=0$, we let go.\n",

    "```{figure} ../images/WorkedEx4.2a.svg\n",

    ":alt: a seesaw with different masses on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Is the seesaw stable for $t \\gt 0$?\n",
    "2) If not: what is the initial acceleration of the mass $2m$ (that is, its acceleration just after release)?\n",
    "\n",
    "::::{tab-set}\n",
    ":::{tab-item} Interpret the problem\n",
    "As always, we start with a drawing. That is, in this case we complement the figure given with relevant information for our interpret-phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/WorkedEx4.2b.svg\n",
    ":width: 40%\n",
    ":alt: Seesaw with relevant quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "We have drawn: the two relevant forces of gravity acting om $m$ and $2m$, respectively, as well as $F_p$ the force of the pivot acting on the seesaw. Moreover, we have (in blue) indicated our coordinate system. This is useful, as we anticipate that we will have to deal with torques and angular momentum. \n",
    "Furthermore, we have drawn the position vector (in green) of both masses with the pivot point as our origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure is made with the idea that the stability of the seesaw for $t \\gt 0$ can be inspected by looking at the torques acting on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: \n",
    ":::{tab-item} Develop the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The seesaw is in balance if the sum of torques on it is zero. Thus, we calculate the net torque. We have chosen the pivot point as our origin, thus\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_i = -L\\hat{x} \\times -mg\\hat{z} + 0 \\times \\vec{F}_p + L\\hat{x} \\times -2mg\\hat{z}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is zero, then the seesaw will not start rotating.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is non-zero, the seesaw will start rotating and we analyze this by using  $\\frac{d\\vec{l}}{dt} = \\sum \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "::: \n",
    ":::{tab-item} Evaluate the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_i = -L\\hat{x} \\times -mg\\hat{z} + 0 \\times \\vec{F}_p + L\\hat{x} \\times -2mg\\hat{z}$$ = mgL\\hat{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The net torques is clearly non-zero: the seesaw is unstable (for $t \\gt 0$). It will start to rotate clockwise and we can find its initial acceleration as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we denote the velocity of $m$ as $\\vec{v}$ then $2m$ will have $-\\vec{v}$ as velocity. This is of course a consequence of both sitting om the seesaw with equal distance to the pivot point. Furthermore, both velocities are always perpendicular to the position vector of their mass. Again this is a consequence of sitting on the seesaw, that can only rotate around the pivot point.\n",
    "Thus the angular momentum of the seesaw (with the two masses) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{l} = \\sum \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{p}_i = -L\\hat{x} \\times mv \\hat{z} + L\\hat{x} \\times -2mv \\hat{z} = 3mvL\\hat{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a constant, as $v$ is a function of time. From N2 for angular momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\vec{l}}{dt} = \\sum \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "we learn that for $t$ small (i.e. gravity is still at 90$^\\circ$ with the position vectors of $m$ and $2m$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3ml\\frac{dv}{dt} = mgL \\Rightarrow a \\equiv \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{1}{3}g$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the initial acceleration is a third of $g$.\n",
    "::: \n",
    ":::{tab-item} Assess the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the seesaw is unstable. We knew that from experience. Our intuition is now backup by a formal physics reasoning.\n",
    "Furthermore, we see that the initial acceleration is positive. Hence the mass $m$ starts moving upwards, also in line with our intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have computed the initial acceleration and, indeed, our answer has the right units: $m/s^2$.\n",
