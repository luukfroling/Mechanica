    "### Circular motion\n",
    "Consider a particle of mass $m$ that is attached to a massless rope of length R. The other end of the rope is fixed in the origin and is free to rotate in a horizontal plane. The particle is made to move in a circular motion wit a velocity that has a constant magnitude $v$. Show that on $m$ a force should act that is parallel to the rope at all times. Gravity is to be ignored.\n",

    ":::{tab-item} Interpret the problem\n",
    "Let' start with a drawing: $m$ is moving over a circle in a horizontal plane. We draw its position vector, $\\vec{r}$, its velocity vector, $\\vec{v}$ and a force, $\\vec{F}$ that can act on $m$.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is clearly a 2-dimensional problem: both $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{v}$ do change in the plane while $m$ moves along the circle.\n",
    "Moreover, since $\\vec{v}$ is not a constant vector (it does have constant magnitude $v$, but clearly its direction constantly changes), we can anticipate that a force **must** be acting on $m$. After all, $\\vec{p} = m \\vec{v}$ is not a constant and, thus, according to N2 a force must act on $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have at least two options to approach this problem: via momentum or via angular momentum. We opt for the latter, as we anticipate that the angular momentum may be a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: \n",
    ":::{tab-item} Develop the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use angular momentum: $\\vec{l} \\equiv \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}$. In this case $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$ are always perpendicular ($m$ moves over a circle and, hence $\\vec{v}$ is tangent to the circle at all times). Thus we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{l} = \\vec{r} \\times m\\vec{v} = mRv \\hat{z}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\hat{z}$ a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of motion. \n",
    "Next we may use Newton 2 for angular momentum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\vec{l}}{dt} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and from this law find restrictions on $\\vec{F}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: \n",
    ":::{tab-item} Evaluate the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we have for this case: $\\vec{l} = mRv \\hat{z}$: a constant vector as $m, R, v$ are all constant.\n",
    "Consequently, from N2 for angular momentum we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{l} = const \\rightarrow \\frac{d\\vec{l}}{dt} = 0 \\Rightarrow \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we see that $\\vec{F} must be parallel to $\\vec{r}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: \n",
    ":::{tab-item} Assess the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our conclusion does make sense: the velocity of $m$ is constant in magnitude, thus no force can act parallel to $\\vec{v}$ since that would 'speed up' $m$. But a force is required to keep $m$ in its circular orbit. After all, its velocity is changing with time and that requires a force acting on $m$.\n",
