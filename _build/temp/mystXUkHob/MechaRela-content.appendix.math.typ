Rather than describing in detail the required mathematical concepts, we here provide a summary of the main concepts, together with some code snippets to illustrate how to implement them in Python. We align with the approach in the TU Delft books:

- #link("https://tudelft-prime-books.github.io/Calculus/")[Calculus] However, here we use the notations and quantities used in this book.
